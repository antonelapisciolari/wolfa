            <h4 class="mb-4">What if devs could test?</h4>
            <p>Empowering developers to take on testing activities is a transformative approach that can bring significant advantages to the software development process. By leveraging the knowledge and skills of developers in testing, teams can achieve greater efficiency, faster feedback loops, and improved overall product quality..</p>

            <h4 class="mb-4">Missing Knowledge</h4>
            <p>One crucial area for developers to focus on is understanding various testing techniques. Equivalence partitioning, boundary value analysis, and error guessing are examples of techniques that can help identify test cases providing maximum coverage and increase the likelihood of detecting defects..</p>

            <h4 class="mb-4">Quality Assistance</h4>
            <p>QA professionals become advocates for quality within the team, promoting its importance throughout the development lifecycle. They collaborate with the development team to define an effective test strategy, identify key testing objectives, and determine appropriate testing techniques. QAs assist in designing comprehensive and efficient test plans that align with project requirements and goals.</p>

            <h4 class="mb-4">Measuring Progress</h4>
            <p>One important measure is the test coverage achieved by the development team. Assess the extent to which the code or features are covered by tests and track the progress in achieving comprehensive coverage.

Another metric to track is the defect density, which involves monitoring the number of defects identified in the software over time. By comparing defect density before and after the shift in responsibilities, you can evaluate the effectiveness of the developer-led testing approach in identifying and addressing issues.</p>

            <h4 class="mb-4">Doting</h4>
            <p>Develper on Test: It involves developers actively participating in testing activities, such as unit testing, integration testing, and even some level of end-to-end testing. This practice aims to improve collaboration, efficiency, and overall software quality by having developers contribute to testing efforts.</p>
