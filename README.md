After downloading the repo, you can simply edit the HTML and CSS files from the `source` folder. To preview the changes you make to the code, you can open the index.html file in your web browser.

* Install dependencies

```
npm install
```

* Run locally

```
npm run dev
```

After that, it will open up a preview of the template in your default browser, watch for changes to source files, and live reload the browser when changes are saved.

## Once all the changes are done, run build and push the new docs folder

After finishing all the customization, you can create a production build by running this command.

```
npm run build
```
